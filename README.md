# Fingerprint-Map-Construction-with-low-cost
A method to construct a fingerprint map using tensor completion to reduce measurement costs, supporting indoor location.
Tensor completion is a powerful technique that can incorporate the relationships within data to infer missing data from partially measured data, significantly reducing measurement costs. Noticing that the construction of a database of fingerprint maps, a critical step in indoor location, usually suffers from high measurement costs, this paper utilizes the tensor completion algorithm to reduce these costs. However, directly applying current tensor completion algorithms faces issues such as complex sample selection, high measurement costs, and slow inference of unmeasured data. To tackle these challenges, this work introduces a novel approach for low-cost and accurate fingerprint map measurement.
